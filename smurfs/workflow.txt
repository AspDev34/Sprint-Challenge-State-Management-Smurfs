The bank valut is your redux store
The bank teller is your reducer
And withdrawal/deposits is your actions
While the withdrawal/deposit slips is your action creators.


(Set up "empty" reducer and initial state) 👉 (Set up store and Provider) 👉
Connect components 👉 Add events and event handlers in UI 👉 Build action creators 👉
write the reducer logic for the actions 👉 Rinse and repeat
